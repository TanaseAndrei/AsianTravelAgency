                        <h2>John Lee</h2>
                        <p>My name is John Lee, i am the founder of the ASIAXPRESS project. I am a back-end engineer,
                            but i can work the front-end too. I mainly
                            use ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. Other technologies that i use in other projects are Spring and
                            Spring Boot. This project was formed in 2013 with me
                            and Y (co-founder). This project formed in the year 2013 with me and a friend of mine (Y).
                            Those times were hard
                            because this idea of going to Asia was pretty unknown due to high prices.
                            When the time got even harder, i was thinking that we will fail this project, but in a day,
                            i
                            was thinking: "Man, everyone think that you have to pay a lot of money to
                            go anywhere in Asia, i need to do something". By that "do something" i was meaning that, i
                            have
                            to create some opportunities for people that really want to got there.
                            There was not just the idea of "i don't want to go because i don't like it" but the idea of
                            "the
                            price it's just too high". Now, in 2020 we made happy over 35.000 people
                            not even in Romania but even in the neighboring countries.

                            engineer, and also my projects include some front-end too.
                            I mainly use ASP.NET AND ASP.NET Core but also can use Spring and Spring Boot framework.
                            Because in the start everything was going down, we nearly thinked of
                            finishing the project. But, i didn't give up and told X to continue, even if things were
                            getting bad. And we did this, and we made it. Now, in 2020 we keep making
                            people happy and the story is far from finishing.

                            developer. Before this project started, i was contacted by X
                            saying "i have seen your portofolio and i have a proposal for you so let's have a cup of
                            coffee and talk some bussiness". We met and discussed about
                            the project he had. It was very interesting because it was something new and very
                            interesting. So far, we made a lot of projects, but the best project we've had so far,
                            was ASIAXPRESS. I'm glad that i met them. Nowadays, we are still making people happy.
